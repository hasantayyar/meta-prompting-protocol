# **Meta-Prompting Protocol Specification (MPP)**

Version 1.5.0

## **1. Abstract**

The Meta-Prompting Protocol Specification (MPP) defines a framework for the on-the-fly generation of self-describing, task-specific communication protocols for AI interactions. It moves beyond a single, static protocol by establishing a set of rules that an intelligent agent (the "Protocol Architect") must follow to create a new, bespoke "Derivative Protocol."

The core principle of MPP is that every message bundle must be fully self-contained, transmitting both the dynamically generated Derivative Protocol Specification (the rules) and the encoded Payload (the data). This ensures that the receiving agent (the "Executor") requires no prior knowledge of the specific protocol being used, thus achieving true model and session agnosticism. MPP provides a blueprint for transforming prompt engineering into a more robust discipline of prompt architecture.

## **2. Core Philosophy**

The fundamental goal of MPP is to enable a more sophisticated and reliable form of AI communication by treating each complex interaction as an opportunity to architect a perfect, purpose-built communication language.

* **From Static to Dynamic:** Instead of relying on a single, universal protocol, MPP allows for the creation of infinite protocols, each optimized for a specific task domain (e.g., creative writing, data analysis, code generation).  
* **Self-Description as a Core Tenet:** By bundling the protocol specification with the payload, the message becomes fully self-describing. This eliminates ambiguity and the need for the receiver to have pre-trained knowledge of a specific communication schema.  
* **Model & Session Agnosticism:** Since every bundle contains the "instruction manual" on how to interpret it, any compliant Executor model can process any MPP-compliant bundle in any session, without prior context.

## **3. Roles and Information Flow**

MPP defines a two-stage, multi-agent workflow.

1. The Protocol Architect: An initial AI agent that receives a user's high-level goal. Guided by the MPP rules, its primary responsibilities are:  
   - a. To analyze the goal and determine the optimal communication structure required.  
   - b. To generate a new, bespoke Derivative Protocol Specification that is perfectly suited for the task.  
   - c. To encode the user's goal into a payload according to the new specification.  
   - d. To assemble and transmit the complete MPP Bundle.  
   - e. To iteratively polish the protocol and payload via a refine -> validate -> revise loop until stable (monadic refinement).  
2. The Executor: A second AI agent (which can be a different model or the same model in a new session) that receives the MPP Bundle. Its responsibilities are:  
   - a. To first parse the derivative_protocol_specification to learn the rules, tags, processors, and structure of the incoming message.  
   - b. To then parse the derivative_protocol_payload according to these just-in-time rules.  
   - c. To execute the task with the high degree of clarity and precision provided by the structured information.  
   - d. To return the final response.  
   - e. To iteratively decode, validate, and polish the response until stable against the protocol constraints (monadic refinement).  

[Optionally] The Quality Assurance Agent: A third AI agent that can be introduced to validate the Executor's output against the original user's intent, using the structured data provided in the MPP Bundle.

When QA is used, it MUST return a JSON object with:
* `verdict` (String, Required): `pass` or `fail`.
* `issues` (Array of Strings, Required): Short violations (empty if pass).
* `repair_examples` (Array of Strings, Required): Use `[]` when nothing needs
  repair; when verdict is fail, include short examples that match the required
  output schema.

## **3.1 Iterative Polishing (Monadic Refinement)**

MPP assumes that both protocol derivation (input layer) and protocol decoding (output layer) benefit from iterative polishing. A Protocol Architect SHOULD run a refine -> validate -> revise loop until the derived specification and payload stop changing materially. An Executor SHOULD apply the same loop during decoding, re-generating and re-validating until the output consistently satisfies the protocol's constraints.

Closed-world outputs (e.g., schema-bound or deterministic outputs) SHOULD use
stability checks as the convergence criterion and run QA only as a final gate.
Open-world outputs (e.g., creative text) MAY not stabilize by simple diff; in
those cases, QA SHOULD be evaluated inside the refinement loop, and the process
SHOULD terminate on QA pass or max-iteration bounds.

### **Stability Criterion**
To make "stop changing materially" testable, a stable output is one that is identical
after normalization for **N consecutive iterations** (RECOMMENDED N=2) and where
the total iteration count does not exceed a max bound (RECOMMENDED max=5).
Normalization SHOULD include stable key ordering, canonical number formatting, and
whitespace trimming. Executors MAY terminate early on a passing QA verdict.

## **4. MPP Bundle Structure**

An MPP-compliant bundle MUST be a JSON object containing the following three top-level keys:

* `meta_protocol_version` (String, Required): The version of the MPP specification being followed (e.g., "1.0.0").  
* `derivative_protocol_specification` (Object, Required): The complete, dynamically generated specification for the Derivative Protocol.  
* `derivative_protocol_payload` (Object, Required): The user's request, encoded according to the rules of the derivative_protocol_specification.
  
```json
{  
  "meta_protocol_version": "1.5.0",  
  "derivative_protocol_specification": { ... },  
  "derivative_protocol_payload": { ... }  
}
```

## **4.1 Ordering and Attention Guidance**

MPP bundles are typically serialized into a single prompt. To reduce attention
confusion, definitions SHOULD appear before references. When serializing
derivative_protocol_specification, use definition-first ordering: protocol_name,
protocol_version (if any), abstract, guiding_principles, tag_definition_schema,
processor_semantics, core_tag_library, then any optional ordered metadata
(e.g., payload_order, processor_pipeline).

JSON objects are unordered. If payload ordering matters, the derivative protocol
SHOULD declare it explicitly (see 5.2). Ordering is conceptual unless a
canonical serialization is used. When enforceable ordering is required,
implementations SHOULD serialize the payload as an array of `[tag, value]` pairs
in `payload_order` and treat unordered objects as invalid.

## **4.2 Conformance and Error Model**
Executors SHOULD validate incoming bundles and return structured errors on failure.
Implementations SHOULD emit errors in the following JSON shape:

```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_payload",
  "message": "Missing required tag: $task",
  "path": "derivative_protocol_payload.$task"
}
```

Recommended `error_code` values: `invalid_bundle`, `invalid_spec`, `invalid_payload`,
`unknown_tag`, `unknown_processor`, `schema_mismatch`.

## **5. Mandatory Components of a Derivative Specification**

To be MPP-compliant, the derivative_protocol_specification object MUST contain the following components:

* **`protocol_name`** (String): A unique name for the generated protocol (e.g., "Structured Prompt Protocol", "Creative Writing Protocol"). 
* **`abstract`** (String): A brief summary of what this protocol is designed to do.  
* **`guiding_principles`** (Object): Rules for how to correctly apply this protocol, including principles like minimalism and fidelity.
* **`tag_definition_schema`** (Schema Descriptor, Array of Strings): An ordered list of required fields for defining each tag (e.g., description, processor, type). Tag definitions MAY include additional optional fields beyond this schema.  
* **`processor_semantics`** (Object): A dictionary describing the expected behavior of each processor mentioned in the tag library.  
* **`core_tag_library`**: The dictionary of all valid tags for this protocol, defined according to the `tag_definition_schema`.

No additional top-level keys are allowed beyond the mandatory components, the
optional ordered metadata defined in 5.2, and the tooling section defined in 5.5.

### **5.1. Processor Semantics**
A processor is a named function or instruction that defines the specific behavior the Executor agent must apply to the data contained within a tag. Each key in this section represents a processor, and its value describes the action it performs.

### **5.2. Optional Ordered Metadata**
Derivative Protocols MAY include ordered metadata when sequence matters:

* **`protocol_version`** (String, Optional): A version identifier for the derivative protocol.
* **`payload_order`** (Array of Strings, Optional): Ordered list of payload tag keys.
  Executors SHOULD process payload tags in this order when present. The payload
  MUST contain exactly these tags and preserve this order.
* **`processor_pipeline`** (Array of Strings, Optional): Ordered list of processor
  names. Executors SHOULD apply processors in this sequence when multiple
  processors are involved. When present, it requires payload_order and MUST
  match the processor order implied by payload_order.

Values in `payload_order` MUST reference keys in `core_tag_library`. Values in
`processor_pipeline` MUST reference processors defined in `processor_semantics`.

### **5.3. Tag Optionality**
Each tag definition MAY include a **`required`** boolean (default: true). Tags
omitted from the payload are only allowed when their definition explicitly sets
`required: false`.

### **5.4 Strategy Selection**
Derivative protocols MUST declare the problem-solving or prompting strategy to be
used by the Executor. This is expressed via a strategy processor in
`processor_semantics` and at least one strategy tag in the `core_tag_library`
(e.g., `$reasoning_strategy`, `$examples`, `$meta_prompt`, or a generic `$strategy`).

If no specialized strategy is needed, the Architect MUST still supply a strategy
tag in the payload with a neutral value such as `any` or `default`. Strategy tags
SHOULD be marked `required: true` unless explicitly optional.

When a strategy requires additional context, the Architect MUST provide the
corresponding tag values in the payload (for example, `few_shot_handler` requires
a non-empty `$examples` array). Executors SHOULD treat missing required strategy
inputs as validation errors.

When present, Executors SHOULD apply strategy processors in `processor_pipeline`
order before generating the final response. Strategy tags SHOULD be explicit and
minimal; they must not replace task content tags and MUST remain consistent with
the protocol's guiding_principles (e.g., fidelity, minimalism). If multiple
strategies are provided, the protocol SHOULD define precedence via
`processor_pipeline` or an explicit policy tag (e.g., `$strategy_policy`).

Acceptable strategy labels (from https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques) are:
`zero_shot`, `few_shot`, `chain_of_thought`, `meta_prompting`, `self_consistency`,
`generate_knowledge`, `prompt_chaining`, `tree_of_thoughts`,
`retrieval_augmented_generation`, `automatic_reasoning_and_tool_use`,
`automatic_prompt_engineer`, `active_prompt`, `directional_stimulus_prompting`,
`program_aided_language_models`, `react`, `reflexion`, `multimodal_cot`,
`graph_prompting`.

### **5.4.1 Strategy Input Requirements**
When a strategy label is used, the derivative protocol MUST declare and supply any
required inputs for that strategy. Implementations SHOULD validate strategy inputs
using a rule table (example):

| Strategy | Required Tags |
| --- | --- |
| `few_shot` | `$examples` (non-empty array) |
| `retrieval_augmented_generation` | `$tool_plan` or `$tool_inputs` |
| `chain_of_thought` | `$reasoning_strategy` |

### **5.5 MCP Tooling (Optional)**
Derivative protocols MAY declare an MCP tooling plan when the Executor must call
tools in a prescribed order before final response. This is expressed via an
`mcp_tooling` object:

* **`mcp_tooling.tools`** (Array of Objects, Required when `mcp_tooling` is present):
  Each tool definition SHOULD include `name` (string), `description` (string),
  and MAY include `input_schema` / `output_schema` JSON schemas.
* **`mcp_tooling.call_order`** (Array, Optional): Ordered list of tool steps.
  Each step is either a tool name string or an object with `tool` and optional
  metadata like `purpose` or `required`. Executors SHOULD execute tools in this
  order when provided.
* **`mcp_tooling.execution_policy`** (Object, Optional): Execution constraints
  such as `max_calls`, `require_all`, or `on_failure`.

When `mcp_tooling` is present, derivative protocols SHOULD include payload tags
for tool inputs or tool plans (for example, `$tool_plan`, `$tool_inputs`, or
`$tool_outputs`) and order them with `payload_order` if sequencing matters.

## **6. Example Walkthrough: A Creative Writing Task**

This example demonstrates the entire MPP flow.

**User Goal:** "Write a short horror story about a lighthouse keeper who finds a strange diary. The tone should be Lovecraftian."

- **Step 1: The Protocol Architect generates a bespoke protocol, the "Creative Writing Protocol (CWP)";**

- **Step 2: The Architect encodes the user's request into a payload according to the CWP specification;**

- **Step 3: The Architect assembles the final MPP Bundle containing both the CWP specification and the CWP encoded prompt:**

```json
{  
  "meta_protocol_version": "1.5.0",
  "derivative_protocol_specification": {  
    "protocol_name": "Creative Writing Protocol (CWP)",

    ],

## **7. Formal Definitions and Compatibility**
MPP uses [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) as normative requirements.

### **7.1 Tag Definition Fields**
`tag_definition_schema` is an ordered list of required fields. Implementations
MAY accept additional fields, but extensions SHOULD be namespaced with `x_` to
avoid collisions.

### **7.2 Minimal JSON Schema (Reference)**
The following JSON Schema is a reference for validation; implementations MAY
extend it to enforce stricter rules.

```json
{
